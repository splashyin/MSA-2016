This website app is built for my interest on Pokemons. 

It is a tool to search any pokemon you want by their name or index. Users are able to search up to 722
Pokemons in one second! It is a convinient and efficient way to learn those new generation Pokemons.

The app shows the health point of the Pokemon and its attack, special attack and abilities, and with a
picture of each pokemon!

The embedded facebook share button allows you to share the app with friends or on your timeline.
